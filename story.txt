In the town of Madison there lived a young boy named Jim. Jim had been living a normal life until his 16th birthday when his dad brought him to a secret room in the basement. There, Jim learned that he was anything but normal. His dad explained that their family held a massive secret that fundamentally changed Jimâ€™s life to the core. What he found out was incredibly facscinating, Jim couldn't even believe it. How could his family have kept this secret for so long? And how did he not find out himself? His mind raced backwards at all the times he spent playing in the basement with his friends all throughout his childhood. Jim began to explore. He scanned the secret room. He saw book shelves, old pictures, and a red button. Unable to contain his curiosity, he pressed it. A bookshelf shifted, and revealed...ANOTHER secret room! There were 3 buttons this time. A blue one, a green one and a red one. A message was etched into the wall that said "To those who wish to pass this primary challenge you must follow the secondary path." Jim stood there a moment to think. What could that mean. Then it finally hit him, red and blue are primary colors, while green is the only secondary colors out of the three buttons. Jim cautiously pressed the green button and a hidden door revealed the mysterious family secret.
